# DIGITAL-CLOCK-
A Digital Clock is an electronic system that displays time in numerical form usually showing hours minutes and seconds.
It operates by using a clock signal generated from an oscillator or crystal source, which is divided into one-second pulses using frequency divider circuits.
These pulses are then counted using counters to update seconds, minutes, and hours in proper sequence.
When seconds reach 59 they reset to zero and increment the minutes and when minutes reach 59, they reset and increment the hours.
